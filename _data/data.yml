      - role: Final Year Project

          I am currently working on a web-based management system project aimed at addressing the challenges faced by business owners in managing their operations manually. The system consists of several modules, including registration, login, account management, stock control, financial information handling, employee details management, order processing, and payment. By implementing this system, we can eliminate data redundancy and duplication, as all information is stored in a central database. It also enhances security by restricting access to authorized users, ensuring data privacy and preventing breaches. Furthermore, the system streamlines financial management by automating calculations and reducing errors typically associated with manual processes. Finally, the platform simplifies order and payment management for customers, allowing them to easily access available products and choose their preferred payment method.

          I developed a web-based system for a web development course that streamlines business operations with features such as pre-configured login credentials, password reset options, and supplier management. The system allows users to manage customer orders, auto-filling existing customer information, and displaying order details in a table. Additionally, the platform facilitates product creation, stock management, and supplier linking, with the ability to edit or delete products as needed. The system also includes staff management capabilities, enabling users to input staff details and allowing admins to view staff status.
